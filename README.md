# üõ°Ô∏è Spring Boot 3 JWT Authentication API

This is a secure RESTful API built with **Spring Boot 3**, implementing **JWT (JSON Web Token)** based authentication and authorization. It includes user registration, login, role-based access control, and stateless session management.

> üí° This project uses a **locally installed MySQL database**, not Docker.

- User login (`/login`)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Stateless authentication using JWT
- Role-based access control (`USER`, `ADMIN`)
- Secure endpoints with Spring Security
- DTO-layer, clean architecture, and service-based design

## üîê JWT Authentication Flow

1. User registers using the `/register` endpoint.
2. User logs in via `/login` with valid credentials.
3. Server generates a **JWT** and returns it in the response.
4. Client includes the token in all protected requests as a Bearer token:


5. A custom filter (`JwtFilter`) extracts the token, validates it, and authenticates the user by populating the `SecurityContext`.

---

## üîê Security Configuration

- JWT is signed using HMAC-SHA256 (`HS256`)
- Tokens include expiration claims
- No server-side session is stored (`STATELESS`)
- Spring Security `SecurityContext` is dynamically populated on every request
- Role-based access is enforced with `hasRole` and `hasAnyRole`
